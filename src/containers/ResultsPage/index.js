                  <li>
                    Laybutt owned a piece of land, and he granted an option to Amoco to purchase the
                    land.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On 28th of July 1972 Mr Laybutt died. His widow was the executrix and sole
                    beneficiary of his estate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On the 23rd of Oct 1972 Amoco served notice of exercise of the option on the
                    widow and delieved a cheque for the deposit to the solicitors acting for the
                    estate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The widowâ€™s lawyers argued that the option could not be exercised after the
                    death of the vendor.

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                  As a general rule, upon the death of a party to a contract his liabilities
                  thereunder pass to his personal representatives. The rule does not apply if the
                  performance of the contract
                </p>
                <p>
                  Amoco still had the right to exercise the option - not withstanding the death of
                  Mr Laybutt.
                </p>
                <p>No binding contract between the appellant and the respondent.</p>
